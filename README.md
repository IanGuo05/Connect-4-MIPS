Welcome to my Midterm Project - Connect 4 of CS 0447. It's a easy board game implemented by MIPs on Mars. It's a dual game that you can play with your friend. Player 1 will be on the offensive and hold "*" chess. Player 2 will be on the defensive and hold "+" chess. 

\b{The program should run like this:}

Welcome to Connect 4. Let's begin!
